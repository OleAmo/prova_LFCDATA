## Meteoland database

Meteoland database offers access to the daily metereological interpolation data,
powered by the [meteoland package](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=meteoland).

```{r meteoland_data}
meteolanddb <- meteoland()
meteolanddb
```

## Access to precalculated data

The Meteoland database has spatial precalculated data as rasters with a 1km
resolution, that can be accessed with the `meteoland_get_lowres_raster`
function:

### Raster formats

This function allows to access the raster for a specified date (as character),
and returns a spatial object, whose class depends on the spatial argument.
Available classes are `raster` (a *RasterBrick* object) and `stars`
(a *stars* object).

```{r get_lowres_raster_stars, warning=FALSE}
meteoland_get_lowres_raster(
  meteolanddb,
  date = as.character(Sys.Date() - 1),
  spatial = 'stars'
)
```

```{r get_lowres_raster_raster, warning=FALSE}
meteoland_get_lowres_raster(
  meteolanddb,
  date = as.character(Sys.Date() - 1),
  spatial = 'raster'
)
```

### Dates available

Dates available covers from 1976-01-01 to the day before current day.

```{r get_lowres_raster_historic, warning=FALSE}
meteoland_get_lowres_raster(
  meteolanddb,
  date = '1977-04-25',
  spatial = 'stars'
)
```

## On the fly points interpolation (resolution 20m)

It is possible to perform *on-the-fly* interpolation of meteorological variables
for a set of points, only for the current natural year (365 days). This is done
with the `meteoland_points_interpolation`:

```{r onthefly_interpolation, warning=FALSE}
# points spatial object, obtained from fes database
points_sf <- lfcdata::fes()$get_data('plot_nfi_4_results', spatial = TRUE) %>%
  slice(1:5)


meteoland_points_interpolation(
  meteolanddb,
  sf = points_sf,
  dates = c(as.character(Sys.Date() - 5), as.character(Sys.Date() - 1)),
  points_id = 'plot_id'
)
```

  > NOTE: This process may take a while depending on the number of points to
  interpolate

  - `sf` must be an sf object containing POINT features
  - `dates` must be a vector of lenght 2, with the starting and the ending date
  - `points_id` is the name of the variable in sf identifying the points.

## Precalculated historical points interpolation (resolution 1km)

For historic dates interpolation, only a lower resolution (1km) is available,
using the `meteoland_historical_points_interpolation` function:

```{r historical_interpolation, warning=FALSE}
meteoland_historical_points_interpolation(
  meteolanddb,
  sf = points_sf,
  dates = c('1976-01-01', '1976-01-05'),
  points_id = 'plot_id'
)
```

Arguments are the same as previously explained.

## Precalculated raster interpolation (resolution 1km)

Interpolation for current and historical dates for polygons (not points) can
be done with the `meteoland_raster_interpolation`. The returned value is a raster
with the interpolated data for the polygons provided.

```{r raster_interpolation, warning=FALSE}
# polygons object obtained from lidar database
sf_polygons <- lfcdata::lidar()$get_data('lidar_municipalities', 'AB') %>%
  slice(1:5)

meteoland_raster_interpolation(
  meteolanddb,
  sf = sf_polygons,
  dates = c(as.character(Sys.Date() - 5), as.character(Sys.Date() - 1))
)
```

  > NOTE: This process may take a while depending on the number of points to
    interpolate

  - `sf` must be an sf object containing POLYGON or MULTIPOLYGON features
  - `dates` must be a vector of length 2, with the starting and the ending date
  - `points_id` is the name of the variable in sf identifying the points.
